# Webemethods with Kubernetes Packages

This folder should contain all the packages that your microservices runtime needs to function properly.

This packages can be developed by you as custom code or a wm package provided by SoftwareAG.

In this example we use the Custom Packages: cdwhnt01, Containerization;
and a wm package: WmJDBCAdapter.
